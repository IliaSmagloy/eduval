      What you use during an actual lesson.
      
      In addition to these functions, you will also subscribe to [MQTT topics](https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-5-mqtt-topics-best-practices/) to receive live updates.  
      The clients should only *subscribe*. Sending messages is handled by the API calls below.  
      The content of the notifications is the same as the corresponding API call.
      
      There are several topics groups, which are fairly similar to the API endpoints:
      * ``lesson/{courseId}/status`` - A message will be published here when the lesson starts/ends.
      * ``lesson/{courseId}/messages/{studentId}`` - Any messages sent to a student will be published here.
      * ``lesson/{courseId}/students`` - Messages about students connecting will be sent here.
      
      IMPORTANT: Please note there is no leading slash (``/``) at the beginning of topic names.  
      Also remember that you can use wildcards.
